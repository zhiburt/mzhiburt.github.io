      <description>&amp;quot;I&#39;m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it&#39;s supposed to be very difficult —&amp;quot; — Hermione Granger regarding transformation [src]
The do There&#39;s a type csv::StringRecords which doesn&#39;t implement IntoIterator but &amp;amp;csv::StringRecords does.
I was thinking if we would keep the structure and the reference along themeslfs, it would be fine. But I know that rust does not allow that (yet, cause it&#39;s self-referenctial struct).</description>

      <description>One upon a time there has been a pile of activitis in Garmin Connect which was not synced with Strava. It was thought it will be an easy thing to do to just syncronize them via some import/export feature. But it turned out not to be the case.

      <description>The site is built by Hugo with Hugo-Octopress theme.
I have bumped into this theme coinsidentaly on this blog http://blog.pnkfx.org/.
If you guess what is the thing in the header. This is my take on awesome octupus from the original theme http://octopress.org/ page. The idea that it resembles a shot from Ninja Turtles tv series.
source - https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/ We override the original theme a little bit to be more compatible with original site.</description>
